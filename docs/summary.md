# Summary
Transitioning from a career in teaching to Technical Writing can feel intimidating, especially if it’s your first time to change a job. 

Fortunately, there are many Technical Writing values skills that Teachers already have, and this job provides similar intellectual challenges, but with greater and more various career flexibility. Your challenge is to take a perspective that many engineers don’t take — what a user needs to know to be able to accomplish their tasks with the software — then find and organize information in a way to fit that perspective.

Believe in yourself and see where it takes you.

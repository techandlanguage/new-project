”Sharing is caring” idea works well in Tech Writers’ world and exchanging experience among themselves is a common practice. 


The most popular website for Technical Communication that includes the latest updates in the world of Tech Writing is [Techwriter.pl](https://techwriter.pl/).


A compendium - essence of knowledge that include standards for Technical Writer Profession, created by experts, all important information you can find on [ITCQF](https://itcqf.org/materials/).


Honestly speaking, whatever activity I took: researching, taking notes, reading etc. that brought me closer to achieving my goal, gaining Tech Comm knowledge, I believe was worth trying.

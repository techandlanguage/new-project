# Who is a Technical Writer? 
Somebody who can break down complex cancepts into more enjoable and simplier formats.
But what exactly is a Technical Writer’s job about? Among the main tasks of a Technical Writer is to provide the user with information necessary to properly use the product, e.g. an application.
Technical Writer acts as an editor, making  grammatical, stylistic, lexical, syntactic and logical corrections. He also ensures that documents are formatted correctly, maintained in the visual style preferred by the company, and comply with all guidelines.
Tech Writer is a translator of various documents, including e-mails to customers, marketing texts, and technical documents.
Technical Writer’s job also has one significant side effect, which is finding mistakes or problems in the product that is being described.
Since many Tech Writers come from a linguistic rather than a technical background, their interaction with the application is more like that of an end user. This  allows to find linguistic inaccuracies in the user interface or UX-related errors.
The Technical Writer supports the UX Designer because he influences the shape of the product by proposing solutions to found problems and reporting improvements. Fixing a problem in a product often reduces the number of issues that need to be covered.
Very often, in a project team, TechWriter helps coordinate the process of creating, reviewing and approving documents, thus ensuring that deadlines are met.

To sum up, Technical Writer is a mixture of several roles in proportions depending on the structure of a given team and the specifics of the project. Tech Writer must adapt to the current needs of the project and, depending on the situation, supports:
analysts,
testers,
project managers,
developers.

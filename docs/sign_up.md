# Sign up for Technical Communication Studies at Vistula University
Technical Communication is a field that deals with translating difficult technical knowledge into a language understandable to an ordinary user. On a daily basis, it is a profession of people who create instructions, help files, procedures or reports, i.e. specialists working in positions such as "Technical Writer", "Technical Documentation Specialist", "Documentalist", "Technical Editor", “User Assistance Specialist” etc.

[Postgraduate studies at Vistula University](https://vistula.edu.pl/kierunki-studiow/komunikacja-techniczna) are the first studies in Poland that practically prepare you to perform this type of work. This is an excellent opportunity for philology graduates to use their language skills in technical applications and start working in the IT technology or industry sector.

This course was created as a result of close cooperation with a group of experienced practitioners dealing with the management of technical documentation in technological projects and the recruitment and education of Technical Writers and technical trainers. It became a response to the huge interest from business (shortage of qualified specialists on the labor market) and students (lack of universities and fields of study preparing students to work in the technical communication industry).

Graduates of the "Technical Communication" postgraduate studies have practical ability to create and publish various types of technical documentation. They can collect information, format content, review and publish various types of documents using specialized tools.
During the classes, students become familiar with the principles of project and documentation team management, creating content publishing strategies, and basic techniques and tools used in professional information management. The study program also covers basic issues in the areas of automation and usability and practically prepares students to obtain the [ITCQF Foundation Level Certificate](itcqf_f.md).

The studies end with a final project, which can be a valuable point in the CV of every beginner Technical Writer.
Graduates can count on employment in technology companies, in particular in the area of IT, industry and new technologies.

I did not hesitate to attend these expanding studies and will never regret!
My attitude towards using technologies in writing - changed,

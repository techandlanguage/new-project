# Join the community & Go to Tech Comm conferences

Firstly, our group on Facebook ‘Tworzenie Dokumentacji” created for Vistula University students and Content Enthusiasts. It is an active group,
a place for Q & A, exchanging thoughts and experiences in the field of Technical Communication. (The link is below).

Another vivid event of community fascinated with Technical Writing is Meet Content Wrocław and Meet Content Kraków.
Each of our meetups aims at developing the participants’ knowledge, sharing experience and interesting ideas from a broadly viewed Content Creation industry. 
The mission of Meet Content is: "We appreciate that not all of us are blessed with a vibrant team that creates a community of practice in our respective fields and we strive to become something of that sort to fill the gap."
Each meetup is followed by an informal part so all participants have time to ask questions, discuss or simply network and mingle with like-minded people.
MeetContentWRO is an offshoot of the already well known soap! conference and aims at creating a community of professionals working with product-related content in Tech and IT.

Third amazing opportunity for Tech Writers is soap! conference. 
Who is the soap! audience? "Our audience (apart from being the best in the world!) spans through a wide variety of roles: technical writers, information architects, content strategists, translators, training developers, graphic designers, project managers, and much more!"

Last but not least, my first contact with Tech Writing was during WritetheDocs conference
Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation.
"We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software." (as it is written in the website)

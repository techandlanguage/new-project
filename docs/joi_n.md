# Join the community & Go to Tech Comm conferences

Firstly, our group on Facebook **Tworzenie Dokumentacji** created for Vistula University students and Content Enthusiasts. 
It is an active group, a place for Q & A, exchanging thoughts and experiences in the field of Technical Communication.

Another vivid event of community fascinated with Technical Writing is **Meet Content Wrocław** and **Meet Content Kraków**.
Each of our meetups aims at developing the participants’ knowledge, sharing experience and interesting ideas from a broadly viewed Content Creation industry. 
The mission of Meet Content is: *We appreciate that not all of us are blessed with a vibrant team that creates a community of practice in our respective fields and we strive to become something of that sort to fill the gap.*
Each meetup is followed by an informal part so all participants have time to ask questions, discuss or simply network and mingle with like-minded people.
MeetContentWRO is an offshoot of the already well known soap! conference and aims at creating a community of professionals working with product-related content in Tech and IT.

Third amazing opportunity for Tech Writers is the **soap! conference**. 
Who is the soap! audience? *Our audience (apart from being the best in the world!) spans through a wide variety of roles: technical writers, information architects, content strategists, translators, training developers, graphic designers, project managers, and much more!*

The **Good Docs Project Community** is a community of technical writers, developers, UX designers, and more who work together to make software documentation better. It is possible to participate actively in creating documentation templates. *Whether you are new to documentation or a seasoned technical writer, joining our community will give you opportunities to mentor and be mentored by others, build your professional network, improve your documentation skills, and help make software documentation better.The Good Docs Project educates and empowers people to create high-quality documentation by providing them with resources, best practices, and tools to enhance their documentation in open source and beyond.*

Last but not least, my first contact with Tech Writing was during **WritetheDocs conference**. 
Write the Docs is a global community of people who care about documentation.
*We consider everyone who cares about communication, documentation, and their users to be a member of our community. This can be programmers, tech writers, developer advocates, customer support, marketers, and anyone else who wants people to have great experiences with software.*

# Transition from English Teacher to Technical Writer
Nowadays, still teaching is a noble profession that involves helping students learn and grow. However, some teachers might feel the need to transition to a different career path, especially because of the low pay and go towards personal development.

The Technical Writer works with the product development teams and obtains necessary information from them. This means many conversations and meetings,
so communication skills are a must for a Technical Writer.
The need to convey all product information requires the Technical Writer to be extremely attentive and patient. It cannot omit any element, otherwise the documentation will be incomplete.
Technical Writers must be able to prepare documentation that is correct not only in terms of content, but also linguistically. Technical documentation must, above all, be understandable to the end user.
Technical knowledge makes the job of a Technical Writer much easier and more independent, what allows better understanding of the product.

The role of Technical Writer is suitable for people who like to write and are also interested in technology. This is a job for someone who is thinking about working in the IT industry, but not as a programmer.
Working as a Technical Writer allows you to observe the process of creating and functioning 
of a product or software. It will interest those who like to analyze, investigate and share knowledge.
If writing is your passion, the Technical Writer path will be a good choice. This job is not only for people who can write linguistically correct texts, but also know how to adapt the text style to the user. 
Working as a Technical Writer is an opportunity to enter the IT industry for people who do not necessarily want to program.

As a Tech Writer I transfer my interpersonal skills and critical thinking skills with previous  acquaintance with preparing instructions and materials related to them which is daily bread in Teacher's life. 
My problem solving skills can help in understanding the scope of work and what business problem are to be solved and then using my project management and classroom management skills to cooperate with teams and create user friendly content.

When transitioning from Teaching into Tech Comm my resume reflects my critical thinking, team collaboration and interpersonal skills.  Additionally,  creating a cover letter could be beneficial to assure a hiring manager and the team that they are paying attention to my credentials to understand how coming from totally different background I could be an asset and how I would fit in on their team.
To get an understanding of the scope and what are the expectations of Technical Content that I am going to create for the audience who would take advantage from my work, I need to demonstrate my communication skills along with project management skills.

Teachers are considered and actually required to possess impressive critical thinking and writing skills. 
These skills can easily be transferred to a Technical Writing position. 
As a Technical Writer you’ll be obliged to write or edit instruction manuals, user guides, and many others. 
Simply speaking, when you are a good writer and creative with language – Technical Writing is definitely a good match.

# How to become a Technical Writer - an Ultimate Guide for English Teachers 
I believe Teaching and tech writing have a lot in common. Essentially, it is taking information from one source and transitioning it into something that is understandable to a particular audience. 

Technical Writer's tasks include creating and revising Technical Documentation such as manuals, reports, brochures, or articles. Classroom management experience and curriculum planning are very similar to these aspects of Tech Writing. Moreover, interpersonal skills are great to have for most jobs and they are important when you are meeting with other departments, SMEs (Subject Matter Experts), and leadership.

The main goal for writing this guide for English Teachers is to show the way how to start the transition to tech writing position step by step. You will find here the reflection on why and what are the benefits of the change and the action you need to take during that process.
